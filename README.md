# adapter
This Java code serves as a basic implementation of an adapter pattern for translating data from different weather APIs into a standardized format for a mobile application. The primary goal is to achieve consistency and a user-friendly presentation of weather data, regardless of the source. The code consists of the following key components and functionalities:

Common Weather Data Class:

CommonWeatherData is a class representing the standardized format for weather data in the mobile application. It includes fields for temperature, humidity, and a weather description, along with getters and setters for each property.
Data Format Classes for Weather APIs:

Two classes, WeatherAPI1Data and WeatherAPI2Data, model the original data formats for two hypothetical weather APIs. Each class includes fields and getters/setters for temperature, humidity, and description data.
Adapter Classes for Each API:

Adapter classes, WeatherAPI1Adapter and WeatherAPI2Adapter, are designed to transform data from the original API formats into the common format used by the mobile application. These adapters use the data from the respective API classes to construct instances of CommonWeatherData.
Main Class for Testing:

The Main class provides a testing environment to showcase the adapters in action. It creates instances of WeatherAPI1Data and WeatherAPI2Data, initializes their properties, and demonstrates how the adapters can convert these data instances into CommonWeatherData.

Finally, it prints out the common data obtained from the adapters.

This code serves as a simplified example for understanding the principles of using adapters to standardize data from different sources. In a real-world scenario, you would need to incorporate additional features, such as error handling, scalability considerations, and integration with actual weather APIs. It's essential to collaborate with API teams to ensure compatibility and adherence to their requirements.
